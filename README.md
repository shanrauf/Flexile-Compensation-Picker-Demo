## Notes

- Unsure if my math is correct on the cash bonus; my value is $0.91 cents higher than Sahil's value but... Maybe he did the math roughly in his head?
- Design-wise, the gigantic total comp number isn't great I think? It obscures actual yearly cash, how much it'd cost to exericse options, etc
